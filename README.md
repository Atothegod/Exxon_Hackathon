# 📦 ExxonMobil Hackathon 2025 – Warehouse Inventory Optimization

## 🧠 Challenge Overview
This project was developed as part of the **ExxonMobil Hackathon 2025** under the theme: **Analytics & Innovation for Sustainable Operations**.

The business challenge centers around optimizing **chemical product logistics** in a polymer supply chain — focusing on **inventory overflow prevention** in warehouse operations, with the goal of maintaining optimal stock levels and reducing D&D (Detention and Demurrage) charges.

## 🚛 Business Case: Polymer Product Logistics

The core problem involves warehouse **inventory imbalance**, where mismatch between **inbound shipments** (based on 3-month demand planning) and **outbound logistics** (truck/marine) causes:
- Overflow costs (D&D)
- Understock scenarios
- Inefficient space utilization

**Warehouse KPIs**:
- Maximize utilization without breaching capacity
- Maintain inventory levels in optimal range (target: 70–80% capacity)
- Predict and adjust future stock fluctuations early

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used includes:
- `Warehouse_Max_Capacity`
- `On_Ground_Inventory_2024`
- `Inbound_Data`
- `Outbound_Data`
- `Forecasted_Demand & Sales`
- `Material_Master_Data`

---

## 🔍 Solution Approach

### 1. Descriptive Analytics (EDA & Monitoring)

- Cleaned and standardized all data sources
- Created inventory monitoring dashboard
- Built **Overflow Risk Alerts**
- Visualized historical trends of inventory, inbound, outbound movement

### 2. Forecast Adjustment

> 🚀 *We performed forecast adjustment using historical accuracy deviation, resulting in significantly improved alignment between actual vs predicted inventory movements.*

- Applied statistical corrections to initial forecast
- Generated `pred_data` for model input

---

### 3. Optimization Engine

#### Phase 1 – Historical Simulation Model

- Developed an optimization model using past data (Jan–Sept 2024)
- Objective: Avoid overflow, minimize understock, balance warehouse utilization
- Constraints: Warehouse capacity, inbound/outbound schedule, demand window

#### Phase 2 – **Predictive Optimization with Forecasted Data**

> ✅ **Build a New Optimization Function for `pred_data`**  
> **Constructed a second optimization function using the same logic, now operating on `pred_data` (forecasted inventory trends).**

- Plug-and-play design allows users to **directly use new forecast data**
- Optimizer recommends ideal monthly in/out scheduling
- Output shows stable inventory around 70–80% with reduced overflow risk

📌 *This step ensures scalability and adaptability without overfitting.*
